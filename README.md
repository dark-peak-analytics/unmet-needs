This R package hosts the '**NHS Formula Health Inequality Impact Calculator**' shiny app. The _NHS Formula Health Inequality Impact Calculator_ shiny app allows interested users to visualise the national, regional and sub-regional health-related effects associated with changes in annual healthcare expenditure. For more information about the tool, please check the shiny app's '_About the tool_' section.

This project was commissioned by **Richard Cookson** at the University of York, and developed by [**Wael Mohammed**](https://github.com/W-Mohammed) at [**Dark Peak Analytics**](https://darkpeakanalytics.com/).

Basic Workflow
------------------------

  1. Update your local repo (`git pull origin main`)
  2. Create a working branch (`git checkout -b new_feature`)
  3. Make changes on your branch
  4. Commit your changes locally (`git add`, `git commit -m "description of your commit"`)
  5. Upload the changes (your branch) to GitHub (`git push origin new_feature`)
  6. Go on to GitHub, create a "Pull Request"
  7. Assign a reviewer who can check your code
  7. After successful review, the changes are merged into the main branch

**Example Usage**

```

# Load the UnmetNeeds package
library("UnmetNeeds")

# Run the shiny app
run_UnmetNeeds_app()
                
```

The web-based application starts with a landing page, during which required functions and data are loaded.

The first tab in the shiny application is the '**Inputs**' tab. Users can study and/or change the assumptions and inputs employed in the calculations.

Switching to any of the two other tabs triggers the analysis behind the scene. Clicking on '**Mortality impact**' loads the second tab.

Clicking on '**QALE impact**' loads the third and final tab.
